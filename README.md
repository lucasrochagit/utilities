# Utilities

**Utilities** is my personal repository, where I put all the utilities that facilitate my work as a developer. It has several scripts and commands from different programming languages, separated by folders. I hope you find something useful here. ^^

## Main features:

  - My terminal user settings of [ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) shell. [Click Here](https://github.com/lucasrochagit/utilities/blob/master/zsh/.zshrc).
